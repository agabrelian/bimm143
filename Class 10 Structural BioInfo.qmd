# Section 1 Intro to RCSB Protein Data Bank

Here we examine the size and composition of the main database of biomolecular structures- the PDB.

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("datasummary.csv", row.names=1)
head(pdbstats)
```

> Q1. What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-ray and electron microscopy?

My pdb stats data has numbers with commas in them which may cause problems. Testing it out:

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```
```{r}
as.numeric(pdbstats$X.ray)
```

Found a function called `gsub()` so now we figure out how it works

```{r}
x <- "49,234"
sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
```

Can use this function for every column
```{r}
commasum <- function(x) {
sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
}

commasum(pdbstats$X.ray)
```

```{r}
totals <- apply(pdbstats,2,commasum)
```


```{r}
round(totals/totals["Total"] * 100, 2)
```
With X.ray 84.54 percent and EM 8.72 percent
```{r} 
# Percentage of Xray and EM
84.54 + 8.72
```

> Q2. What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
proteintotal <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", pdbstats[1,7]))

round(proteintotal/totals["Total"] * 100, 2)

```

```{r}
(215684/249751891 * 100)
```

# Predict the dynamics or flexibility of an important protein:

```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```

```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(hiv)
```

Doing NMA:

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
modes <- nma(adk)
plot(modes)
```
There are certain regions of the sequence that is more flexible.

Make a "movie" called a trajectory to predict motions:
```{r}
mktrj(modes, file = "adk_m7.pdb")
```

Then we can open it in Mol*
